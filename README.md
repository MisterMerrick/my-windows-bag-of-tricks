### My Windows Software Toolbox
##### (or software that I find indispensible or close to it)

Originally intended as a Windows post-install checklist of the software I like to keep on my machine.

That will likely remain. 

Want to expand it to my toolbox of software.

I may not necessarily have all of these applications installed on my machines at the same time.

I do tend to have a mental list of "must have" programs for me to feel like I can do what I want/need to do.
