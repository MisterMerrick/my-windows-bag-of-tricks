### A Windows 10 post install checklist
##### (or something like that)

I love to tinker and break my physical PC and virtual machines and this is just a list to help me remember all of the different applications I like to use and tweaks I make to the OS and so forth.  In short: this is a personal list of Microsoft Windows compatible software that I use at one time or another.

I may not necessarily have all of these applications installed on my machines at the same time. I do tend to have a mental list of "must have" programs for me to feel like I can do what I want/need to do.
